The map is built on extensive research, drawing information from many archaeological and historical resources, brought together to show the historical development of the city. The talk will highlight how we create our maps, how we delivered our Bradford project and share the stories and learnings that the publication has uncovered, which are surprising even its authors in creating a new and more detailed narrative of Bradford’s history.
